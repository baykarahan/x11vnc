10/05/2019 08:45:22    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 08:45:22    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 08:45:22      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 08:47:15      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 08:49:24      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 08:50:27    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 08:50:27    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 08:50:27      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 08:55:52    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 08:55:52    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 08:55:52      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 08:59:47    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 08:59:47    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 08:59:47      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:01:49      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:01:57    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:01:57    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:01:57      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:09:57      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:12:07    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:12:07    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:12:07      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:18:16 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
10/05/2019 09:18:16   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
10/05/2019 09:18:16   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
10/05/2019 09:18:16    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:18:16    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:18:16      moved window is released in the new position.
10/05/2019 09:18:16   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
10/05/2019 09:18:16   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to

10/05/2019 09:18:16   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting

10/05/2019 09:19:48    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:19:48      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:20:31   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
10/05/2019 09:20:31   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
10/05/2019 09:20:31    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:20:31    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:20:31      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:20:40    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:20:40    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:20:40      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:20:49    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:20:49    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:20:49      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:20:57    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:20:57    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:20:57      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:22:57    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
10/05/2019 09:22:57    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:22:57      moved window is released in the new position.

10/05/2019 09:23:05    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
10/05/2019 09:23:05      moved window is released in the new position.
